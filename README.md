# Jeff Geerling's Retro Computers

This repository contains all the issues and information surrounding the various retro computing devices I own or _have_ owned. Well, at least as much as I can process as a YouTuber who doesn't have infinite time. I actually have a lot more gear that is not cataloged or documented anywhere, as do most people addicted to old technology :)
